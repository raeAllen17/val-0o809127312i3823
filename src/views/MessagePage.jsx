                    How are you? I hope you are okay while you're reading this.
                    I am so sorry that I can't take you out yet on a special day such as February 14.
                    Let us push our relationship until the day where we can just go out whenever we want
                    and wherever we want.

                    <br />
                    <br />

                    These past few months have been so much fun with you. We actually got to go our on our own
                    several times, I thought those days were nowhere near before it actually happened. I would like
                    to express how happy I am during those moments because I really do like earting at restaurants.

                    <br />
                    <br />

                    Let us have a talk about our relationship sometime, a serious one. I feel like I am not doing enough to satisfy you,
                    let me know if I could still make you laugh and if you still feel loved by me.

                    <br />
                    <br />

                    For now, Happy <span className="text-red-500" >hearts</span> day.

                    <br />
                    <br />

                    See you soon, baby.
